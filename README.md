# Epic (Bash) Script Collection by Marcsello

_This is a small selection of scripts I made to make my life easier. They are all single file scripts and they do not deserve their own repo (well.. anymore)_

### There they are: ###
* **[wifi-activator](https://github.com/marcsello/epic-script-collection/blob/master/doc/wifi-activator.md)**
  * Small script helping un-stuck a stuck wifi device
* **[vnc-manager](https://github.com/marcsello/epic-script-collection/blob/master/doc/vnc-manager.md)**
  * Small script to start/stop multiple thightvnc servers
* **[service_watchdog](https://github.com/marcsello/epic-script-collection/blob/master/doc/service_watchdog.md)**
  * Service Watchdog script with failure reporting
* **[new](https://github.com/marcsello/epic-script-collection/blob/master/doc/new.md)**
  * Script to create new files with shebang already added

(Every Script have it's own readme file in the doc directory)
